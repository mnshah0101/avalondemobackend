To ensure that elections are decided by \nvoters rather than bankrolls, the federal government \nhas, for more than a century, restricted corporate \nand union spending in candidate elections. The \nrationale for these restrictions is clear and com-\npelling. Corporate wealth can unfairly influence the \noutcome of elections.  \n Beginning in 1907, Congress has enacted a series \nof laws that prohibit corporations and unions from \nspending their general treasury funds on federal \ncandidate elections. The Federal Election Campaign \nAct of 1971, as amended, is the most comprehensive \nof these laws. FECA bans corporations and unions \nfrom making “contributions or expenditures in \nconnection with any [federal] election.” 2 U.S.C. \n§ 441b(a).  \n FECA’s restrictions apply not only to “electioneering \ncommunications” that expressly advocate the elec-\ntion or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, but \nalso to “electioneering communications” that refer \nto a candidate within 30 days of a primary election \nor 60 days of a general election. § 434(f)(3)(A). \nFECA’s legislative history confirms that Congress \nintended its restrictions to reach advertisements \nthat are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.

        "contexts": ["    (overruled on other grounds by Citizens United v. FEC , \n130 S. Ct. 876 (2010)), was the first time since \nBuckley v. Valeo , 424 U.S. 1 (1976), that the Court \nconsidered whether and how the First Amendment \napplies to limitations on the financing of political \nspeech by corporations, including nonprofit \ncorporations.  Section 203 of BCRA amended the \nFederal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA) \nto add 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2), which provided that: \n \n[T]he term “electioneering communication” means any broadcast, cable, or satellite \ncommunication which—\n(i) refers to a clearly identified candidate for \nfederal office;\n(ii) is made within—\n(I) 60 days before a general election or \n30 days before a primary election \nto select candidates for the office sought \nby the candidate; and\n(II) 30 days before a primary election \nto select candidates for the office sought \nby the candidate of a political party, in \nthe case of a communication which \nrefers to a candidate for an office other \nthan President or Vice President and is \nmade by any person other than such \ncandidate or the candidate’s authorized \npolitical committee; and\n(iii) in the case of a communication which \nrefers to a candidate for any of the \nFederal offices other than President or \nVice President, is targeted to the relevant \naudience. \n15 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2)(C) . \n   \nThe WRTL Court upheld § 203 in its entirety, \nrejecting WRTL’s challenge to both the primary and \nfallback definitions of “electioneering \ncommunication.”  127 S. Ct. at 2666-68.  The \nCourt rejected WRTL’s facial challenge because \n§ 203 “is not overbroad in the sense that it attempts \nto regulate all election-related speech.”  Id. at \n2666.  Rather, the Court concluded, “the provision \nrestricts ‘communications broadcast to the \ngeneral public’ that are targeted to voters and that \nrefer to a candidate.”  Id. at 2667 (quoting McConnell \n, 540 U.S. at 191). \n The Court then rejected WRTL’s claim that the \nfallback definition in § 203(b)(2)(C)(ii)(II) is \nunconstitutional.  As a threshold matter, the Court \nnoted that WRTL failed to argue that this definition \nwas unconstitutional as applied to WRTL’s \nparticular ads, and that it was therefore barred from \nraising this challenge on appeal.  Id. at 2668.  Even if \nWRTL had properly raised the issue, the Court held, \n§ 203(b)(2)(C)(ii)(II) is “reasonably read to \nregulated . . . only ‘communications broadcast to \nthe general public’ that are susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to \nvote for or against a specific candidate.”  Id. at \n2669.  The Court also rejected WRTL’s argument \nthat the 30/60-day blackout periods in § \n203(b)(2)(C)(ii) were unconstitutional.  Because \nthe statute “reach[es] only ‘communications \nbroadcast to the general public’ . . . that can be \nunderstood as something other than an appeal to \nvote for or against a specific candidate,” the Court \nconcluded, the blackout periods “do not ban \nning itself.”  Id. \n The Court, therefore, held that “the speech \nregulated by § 203 is campaign speech . . . subject \nto regulation as a constitutionally permissible time,\nplace, and manner restriction.”  Id.  Like other \nrestrictions on campaign speech, the Court \nconcluded, § 203 is “subject to a ‘less rigorous’ test \nthan would apply to restrictions on core political \n speech.  McConnell , 540 U.S. at 189.”  Id.  \n \nII. C ONSTITUTIONAL S IGNI F ICAN CE \n \nA. W RTL \n 1. § 203 is a Content-Based Restriction on \nPolitical Speech \nWRTL ’s most significant holding for present \npurposes is its conclusion that § 203 is a content- \nbased restriction on political speech. 127 S. Ct. at \n2666-67.  Although the Court rejected WRTL ’s claim \nthat § 203 was unconstitutionally overbroad, it \nnonetheless concluded that the provision was a \ncontent-based restriction because it applied only to \ncommunications that “refer[ ] to a candidate” for \nfederal office.  Id.  \nThis conclusion is of critical importance, because \nthe Court has recognized that content-based \nrestrictions on political speech are “presumptively \ninvalid” and “subject to strict scrutiny.”  McConnell \n, 540 U.S. at 205-06.  Under strict scrutiny, a content- \nbased restriction on political speech can survive \nconstitutional scrutiny only if the government can \ndemonstrate that the restriction is narrowly tailored \nto serve a compelling state interest.  Id. at 206.  This \nis a heavy burden, and one that § 203 cannot \nsatisfy.  For the reasons explained below, the \ngovernment’s purported interests in § 203—reducing \nthe appearance of corruption and ensuring that \ncorporate wealth does not distort the democratic \nprocess—are insufficiently compelling to justify the \nstatute’s content-based restriction on political speech.
